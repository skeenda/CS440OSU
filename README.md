The web application is called "What Should We Watch". It is a movie search engine that provides suggestion of what to watch to a user based on their interests.

Ensure you have PHP installed.

Navigate to the Server directory

Then run the following:

php -S localhost: "Desired Port"

Note: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection so it is recommended to not host this public, only localhost!
